# Module_11_Challenge
Mars Data and Scrape


**Module 11 Challenge-Part 1**

  The first part of the challenge was rather easy.  Anuj and team dedicated quite a bit of class time showing us how to use the Chrome executable (.exe) in 2 ways.  The first way is by placing the executable into a path, where I could just pull it. Whereas for this assignment I just placed the (.exe) in the same environment jupyter notebook.
  
  
  The rest of Part 1 was making sure I found the correct class to pull the data from.



**Module 11 Challenge-Part 2**

  This was a bit more difficult for me because I am not a proficient in running "For Loops."  I want to thank the TA Bomin for helping me with it.  The first time I ran the "For Loop" all the data exported in a list, forcing me to stop because without the proper export, I could not put any data into a DataFrame.  The DataFrame exported correctly with Bomin's help.

  Converting the DataFrame from Object to different DataTypes was done via the .astype function

  I was able to get the Avg Min Temp by Month and the Avg Pressure by Month via the .groupby function

  Unfortunately there were parts of this challenge that I did not know how to complete:
      
      Identify the coldest and hottest months in Curiosity's location      
      
      How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a Martian year?

      

    **Please provide feedback on the ReadME.  I want to know what I can do to be better at this.**
